"The fuzzy rules can be used to decide the applicable IPC section by assigning fuzzy values to the different variables in the rules. For example, the variable ""severity of the theft"" can be assigned a fuzzy value of ""high"" if the stolen property is valuable, and a fuzzy value of ""low"" if the stolen property is not valuable. The fuzzy rules can then be used to determine the applicable IPC section based on the fuzzy values of the different variables.

The following are the possible IPC sections that can be applied to the given FIRs:

    Section 378 - Theft: This section is applicable if the accused has stolen property belonging to the complainant.
    Section 323 - voluntarily causing hurt: This section is applicable if the accused has hurt the complainant.
    Section 506 - criminal intimidation: This section is applicable if the accused has threatened to kill or harm the complainant.
    Section 354 - Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty: This section is applicable if the accused has assaulted or used criminal force on the complainant with the intention of outraging her modesty.
    Section 279 - rash driving or riding on a public way: This section is applicable if the accused has driven or ridden a vehicle in a rash or negligent manner, thereby endangering the life or personal safety of others.
    Section 280 - causing hurt by rash or negligent driving: This section is applicable if the accused has caused hurt to the complainant by driving or riding a vehicle in a rash or negligent manner.

The following are the fuzzy rules that can be generated to decide the applicable IPC section:

    If the accused has stolen property belonging to the complainant, then Section 378 is applicable.
    If the accused has hurt the complainant, then Section 323 is applicable.
    If the accused has threatened to kill or harm the complainant, then Section 506 is applicable.
    If the accused has assaulted or used criminal force on the complainant with the intention of outraging her modesty, then Section 354 is applicable.
    If the accused has driven or ridden a vehicle in a rash or negligent manner, thereby endangering the life or personal safety of others, then Section 279 is applicable.
    If the accused has caused hurt to the complainant by driving or riding a vehicle in a rash or negligent manner, then Section 280 is applicable.",
