                from brand monitoring to customer feedback analysis. \s
                Python is a popular programming language used for text \s
                analysis and mining, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) \s
                library is one of the most widely used libraries for natural language \s
                processing in Python.

                This tutorial will provide a step-by-step guide for performing sentiment \s
                analysis using the NLTK library in Python. By the end of this tutorial, \s
                you will have a solid understanding of how to perform sentiment analysis \s
                using NLTK in Python, along with a complete example that you can use as \s
